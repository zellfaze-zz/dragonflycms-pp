Place the Modules and Language folders in the publicly accessible root of your dragonfly site.
Install and activate the module via the modules administration section.


IMPORTANT! If you are upgrading from Personality Pages:

If you want to keep your old data intact, DON'T uninstall Personality Pages!
Instead, disable the module, or delete /modules/Personality manually. 

This will leave the database entries intact.

Upon attempting to install Personal Pages, you may get a SQL error. This is because the tables 
it is trying to create already exist. I've included a hacked copy of cpg_inst.php which
will work around this issue. Use it to replace the copy in /modules/Personal

In the future, if you want to uninstall and reinstall the module, you will need to switch
the files back to recreate the initial database entries.
